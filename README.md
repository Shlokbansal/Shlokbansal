#  Hi, I'm Shlok Bansal

**Biomedical Engineer** | **Data Science Graduate Student @ Northeastern Silicon Valley**  
 Passionate about combining **AI, Machine Learning, and NLP** to build impactful, human-centered solutions.

---

## What I’m Working On:
- **Emotion Recognition in Clinical Contexts**  
Collaborating on a **multimodal AI system** to detect complex human emotions (guilt, empathy, distress) using **BERT and ClinicalBERT**. Contributing to literature review, dataset evaluation, and project development for future healthcare applications.

- **Continuous Learning:**  
Currently exploring **Deep Learning, MLOps, Model Deployment**, and **Healthcare AI** through hands-on projects and coursework.
